    <div id="BC">
        <h2> His Start</h2>
        <p>
            In 1988 Doom created a group called KMD with his younger brother
            known as DJ Subroc and another MC named Onyx the Birthstone Kid. He was calling
            himself Zev Love X during this time. A rep at A&R learned about KMD and got them 
            signed to Elektra Records. They released their first album with Elektra in 1991
             named "Mr.Hood". It became a minor hit through its singles "Peachfuzz" and "Who Me?".
            <br>
            Unfortunetly in 1993 memeber Subroc(Dooms younger brother) was hit by a car and killed before
            the second album was even released. This led the group to being dropped
            by Elektra Records within the SAME WEEK. From the loss of his brother
            Doom completely let go of his rap career from 1994-1997. Living in a difficult 
            situtation, being homeless and sleeping on the benches of Manhattan. This led 
            him to moving to Atlanta and swearing revenge to the music indusrty that deformed 
            him terribly.

        <h2>Birth of DOOM</h2>

        <p>
            In 1997, Doom began to freestyle secretly at open-mic events at a cafe
            in Manhattan. He would perform on stage without reveling his identity by wearing
            a sock over his head. He later started wearing a mask that was similar to Doctor 
            Doom who is shown on the cover of is 1999 album Operation: Doomsday. He is to be 
            seen always with the mask on even in photos and performances. He released three singles:

                <li>The M.I.C(1998)</li>
            </ol>
            In 2001 he went by the name Metal Fingers and released an album that were just beats. Many of 
            the beats that he created were later used throughout his work. In 2003, going by King Geedorah
            he released the album Take me to Your Leader. King Geedorah was credited as the producer
            and had featured guests on the songs. One of the features include himself as MF DOOM. The album
            Vaudeville Villian was released as well. It was under the name Viktor Vaughn, which is a play on 
            Dr.Doom (his real name was Viktor Vaughn Doom).

    <div id="main">
        <h2>His Recognition</h2>
        <p>
        In 2004 MF DOOM released the album MM..Food under the label Rhymesayers
        Entertainment. Then releasing the album Madvilliany with the producer Madlib
        the album became a success. The album recieved tons of publicity and was on
        the Rolling Stone, Washington Post, New York Times, and The New Yorker. This 
        led to the first tour of Madvilliany. He later decided to take a bigger step to
        the mainstream in 2005 creating the group Danger Doom and releasing The Mouse 
        adn the Mask. He collaborated with DJ Danger Mouse and released the album on 
        October 11, 2005. He also collaborated with Cartoon Network's Adult Swim and 
        featured characters and voice actors. This album would reach #41 on the Billboard
        200.

    <!--Wrapping up his career-->

    <div id="end">
        <p>
            MF DOOM continued to produce tracks in 2006 but the tracks were for Ghost
            face Killah for 2 albums. He also hosted the Adult Swim Christmas special
             and was a feature in the song November Has Come by the Gorillaz in their
             2005 album Demon Days. Ghostface Killah and Doom worked on an album called
             Swift & Changeable rumored to be releasing soon but in fact did not. He continued to work on 
             Adult Swim doing voice overs and ads. Late 2009, it was confirmed that Doom would release 
             an album named MF and his name would change to just DOOM. The first single for the next 
             Madvilliany ablum was dropped through Adult Swim in 2010 called Expektoriation. Unfortunetly 
             Madvilliany 2 would not be released and later in 2020 MF DOOM would be pronounced dead.
             I dont really want to go in depth as how he passed but it was due to many mishaps in the hospital he 
            was in and was neglected. It was a difficult time due to COVID, hospitals barely had room and
            prioritized patients with COVID.

    <!--Ending his story giving my thoughts-->

    <footer id="closing">
        Daniel Dumile was an inspiration to many artist including 
        probably everyone in ODD FUTURE especially Tyler the Creator and Earl Sweatshirt. Many loved his music
        and his love for telling his villious story. He lost his brother so early and was mistreated by so many 
        in the industry and later even lost his son so young. His wife mentioned that he was a very loving husband
        and father. She loved what he had built and wants his story to be known. "Just remeber ALL CAPS when you 
        spell the man name". MF DOOM.
